Mark ``INameFromTitle`` deprecated, in this distribution, as it has been moved to ``plone.base``.
It will be removed in Plone 7.0.
We do not show a deprecation warning, because doing so would break content types with this interface name in the behaviors list.
Recommended is to use ``plone.namefromtitle`` as behavior name, then it works in all supported Plone versions.
