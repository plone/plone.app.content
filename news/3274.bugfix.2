Fixed stored XSS from user fullname and possibly other places where ``getVocabulary`` is called.
This is an alternative to the ``plone.app.users`` workaround from `PloneHotfix20210518 <https://plone.org/security/hotfix/20210518/stored-xss-from-user-fullname>`_.
It looks like Plone 6 is not vulnerable, but this change makes sure.
