  new ids when possible, to avoid errors when adding invalid

  [davisagli]


2.0.7 (2011-07-04)
------------------

  so that 'Content' tab remains selected after a folder action.

  [thomasdesvenain]


2.0.5 - 2011-04-06
------------------

- Fix display of title in folder contents table.
  [elro]


2.0.4 - 2011-04-04
------------------

- Reduce the required table item keys to ``id`` or ``getId``.
  [elro]

- Make all columns other than title optional in table view.
  [elro]

- It is the portal_type that is listed in `typesUseViewActionInListings`.
  [elro]


2.0.3 - 2011-03-15
------------------

- Preserve filename extension when picking a unique name.
  [elro]

- Depend on ``Products.CMFPlone`` instead of ``Plone``.
  [elro]


2.0.2 - 2010-12-23
------------------

- Avoid using a mutable default argument in the FolderContentsTable code. In a
  LinguaPlone environment after viewing the folder contents of a collection,
  the language of that collection got stuck as a content filter and wasn't
  reset anymore. Viewing the folder contents of any item in a different
  language showed an empty table until the Zope instance was restarted.
  [tom_gross, hannosch]

- Use the folder as the factory expression context when a front-page
  is used as the display for the folder. Tests in `plone.app.contentmenu`.
  [rossp]


2.0.1 - 2010-07-18
------------------

- Update license to GPL version 2 only.
  [hannosch]


2.0 - 2010-07-01
----------------

- Fetch the folder contents view icon more directly.
  [davisagli]


2.0b5 - 2010-05-01
------------------

- Speed up folder contents view by only creating the necessary data for
  items in the batch to be displayed.
  [witsch]

- Disable KSS updates for "select all" and "show all items/batched" in
  "folder contents" view as they are broken for folders with lots of content.
  [witsch]


2.0b4 - 2010-04-08
------------------

- Slight reconfiguration of the order of the folder_contents table;
  dragging is now in the first column, and visually much improved.
  [limi]

- Fixing possibly our #1 integrator issue, where do you find the template
  that corresponds to the folder_contents URL? Grep gives you nothing, since
  this was renamed to foldercontents.pt in the 3.x series. Renamed it back to
  folder_contents.pt, and adjusted the ZCML accordingly.
  [limi]

- Removed unused template foldercontents_table.pt. We have been using table.pt
  for ~2 years, it's time to kill it off.
  [limi]


2.0b3 - 2010-03-05
------------------

- Only display batching controls if we have more than the batch size number of
  elements. Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10281
  [esteele]

- Adapt tests to new policy introduced in
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/changeset/34375
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/10236
  [tomster]


2.0b2 - 2010-02-18
------------------

- Use non-skins versions of `isExpired` and `pretty_title_or_id` to speed
  up the `folder_contents` view a bit.
  [witsch]

- Updated templates to follow the recent markup conventions.
  References http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9981
  [spliter]

- Mixed in Acquisition.Implicit back into the CMFAdding class. CMF skins depend
  on it inside templates. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9865.
  [hannosch]

- Added test for adding view and Acquisition interaction. This references
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9865.
  [hannosch]


2.0b1 - 2010-01-25
------------------

- Move logic for deciding source of folder contents listing to a new function
  so the FolderContentsTable view is useful as a base for subclasses.
  [MatthewWilkes]


2.0a3 - 2009-12-27
------------------

- Removed no longer required _getCharset handling from the name chooser. Plone
  only supports utf-8 as a database encoding.
  [hannosch]

- Use the getIconExprObject method of the FTI instead of the deprecated
  getIcon method.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed package dependencies and prefer Acquisition-less BrowserView.
  [hannosch]

- Introduce a new marker interface IContentsPage noting that the current
  request is showing the folder contents page.

  Fixed that. This closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9634
  [vincentfretin]

- Removed deprecated use of is_folderish script.
  [davisagli]

- Added support for the new add_view_expr property available on FTIs. This
  can be used to construct a URL for add views.
  [optilude]

- Removed PortalContent.__init__ call including an id argument from Item, as
  there's no base class which accepts this argument.
  [hannosch]

- Added package dependencies.
  [hannosch]


1.7 - 2010-04-07
----------------

- Fixed serious regression introduced in c31433. You cannot pass encoded
  strings into Message mappings.
  [hannosch]


1.6 - 2010-03-01
----------------

- Make the folder contents listing fall back to using the portal_type id when
  the title is not available (e.g. if the portal_type is missing).
  [davisagli]

- Fixed erroneous tfooter tag in table.pt (used in folder contents). It should
  be tfoot, not tfooter.
  [limi]

- Fixed not translatable message in table.pt: "Select ${title}"
  appears when the mouse is over a checkbox in folder_contents.
  [vincentfretin]

- Fixed folder_add_settings_long default message, it used "context"
  instead of "here".
  [vincentfretin]


1.5 - 2009-05-16
----------------

- Correct detection if an item in the review list is folderish.
  Partially fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8926

  Partially fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8926
  [csenger]

  add tests. This fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/9164
  [csenger]


1.4 - 2009-03-04
----------------

- Changed the folder contents tables to deal properly with the Acquisition
  context of self.context. In Five's browser views, you need to do
  aq_inner(self.context). This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/7686.

- Made the tests less fragile in regard to browser errors.
  [hannosch]

- Translate the name of the content types in folder_contents.
  Fixes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8459
  [csenger]

- Made the tests less fragile in regard to browser errors.
  [hannosch]

- Fixed folder contents tests, which tried to remove a no longer existing
  portlet assignment.
  [hannosch]

- Small cleanup and removed hard-dependency on KSS.
  [hannosch]

- Added missing i18n markup to batching.pt. This closes
  http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8501
  [dunlapm]

- Fixed content type name for items in folder_contents when you hover any.
  Closes http://dev.plone.org/plone/ticket/8223
  [spliter]

- Fixed title and description for non AT content in folder_contents where
  widget method was acquired from parent AT content.
  [elro]


1.3 - 2008-07-07
----------------

- Use the widget itself to render the title and description and include the
  usual viewlet managers around the title.
  [wichert]

- Fixed i18n markup in table.pt.
  [naro]


1.2 - 2008-04-22
----------------

- Added authenticator token for CSRF protection.
  [witsch]

  [wichert]


1.1.1 - 2008-03-24
------------------

- Improved the batch disabling action so that it only shows up
  when there is a batch.
  [jvloothuis]

- Made the reviewlist more powerful by making the folder contents
  selection features available for it as well.
  [jvloothuis]

- Changed the replacement command to actually replace the div, not
  just its inner content. This fixes a problem with browsers like
  Internet Explorer which did not apply the drag and drop script
  after updating.
  [jvloothuis]

- Fixed i18n markup in table.pt.
  [hannosch]


1.1.0 - 2008-03-08
------------------

- Made it possible to show all the items in the folder contents at
  once (no batching). This can be used to drag items across batch
  boundaries and makes it easier to move an item from the end of
  the folder to the beginning.
  [jvloothuis]

- Update the folder_factories view to add the FTI id to the output of
  of addable_types. This makes it possible for callers to manipulate its
  results.
  [wichert]

- Fixed the 'id' attribute of CMFAdding class. By default, it is an
  empty string, which confuses absolute_url() and causes the <base />
  tag to be set incorrectly. This in turn confuses KSS, and probably
  other things.
  [optilude]


1.0 - 2007-08-16
----------------

- Fixed missing i18n markup on the folder contents view.
  [hannosch]
